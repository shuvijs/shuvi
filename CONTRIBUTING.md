### Local Development

## About Publishing

Shuvi uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage monorepo versions and publish.

### For Developers

After writing code and complete test, run `pnpm changeset` to add a changeset, or run `pnpm changeset pre enter xxx` to add a changeset with prereleases version. And then bring this changeset file to git.
